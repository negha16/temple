			<div class="box-content"><h4>The Story of Shiva and Parvati</h4><br>
<p>Goddess Sati took birth again on earth as the daughter of King Himavat and Queen Mena. They named her Parvati. Narad Muni came to look at the baby and declared she is destined to marry Shiva. While growing up, she would lose herself thinking about Lord Shiva.</p>

<p>When she was of marriageable age, she went to the Himalayas to perform penance and appease Lord Shiva and marry him. Lord Shiva was impressed by her devotion and knew about her desire, but he was still in mourning for Goddess Sati. He asked Parvati to serve him as the dasi, as he thought that the rough life will dissuade her. Parvati was pleased to serve him and stayed with him for many years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the gods and people were being terrorised by the demon, Taraka. When they approached Lord Brahma for help, he said that Lord Shiva and Parvati’s son will kill the demon. As the gods were getting restless, they decided to help Parvati win Lord Shiva’s affection. They sent Lord Kama, the god of love, to Mount Kailash. He saw Parvati at Lord Shiva’s feet, sowing a garland. He immediately aimed an arrow at them which struck Lord Shiva.</p>

<p>Lord Shiva opened his eyes and fell in love with Parvati. But he suddenly realised that Lord Kama has played a trick with him. He banished Parvati from his abode.</p>

<p>Undeterred, Parvati performed severe penance for years. Finally she remembered her pervious life and realised that she is none other than the reincarnation of Goddess Sati. When Lord Shiva sensed that as well, he decided to test her.</p>

<p>One day, an old brahmin approached Parvati and asked her, “Why are you performing severe penance, my dear? What do you wish to attain?” Parvati told him about her desire to marry Lord Shiva. The brahmin cringed and asked, “Why would a beautiful maiden like you want to marry someone who covers his body with ash and wears tiger skin?”</p>

<p>Parvati was furious and replied, “What do you know about him? I am the reincarnation of Goddess Sati, his other half. We are incomplete without each other.” Suddenly, Lord Shiva revealed his true from to her and consented to marry her.</p>

<p>The gods came down from heaven to attend the grand wedding of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. They retired to Mount Kailash to lead a happy married life.</p>
