			<div class="box-content"><h4>1. The story of Ayyapas Birth</h4>
<p>After Goddess Durga killed the demon king Mahishasur, his sister, Mahishi, set out to avenge her brother. She carried Lord Brahma's boon that only the child born of Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva could slay her, or, in other words, she was indestructible. To save the world from annihilation, Lord Vishnu, incarnated as Mohini, wed Lord Shiva, and out of their union Lord Ayyappa was born.<p>
<h4>Why Ayyappa Is Called Manikandan</h4>
<p>Ayyappa is also commonly known as "Manikandan" because, according to the legend of his birth, his divine parents tied a golden bell (mani) around his neck (kandan) soon after his birth. As the legend goes, when Shiva and Mohini abandoned the baby on the banks of the Pampa river, King Rajashekhara, the childless monarch of Pandalam, found the newborn Ayyappa, accepted him as a divine gift, and adopted him as his own son.</p>
<h4>The Story of Ayyappa's Childhood</h4>
<p>After King Rajashekhara adopted Ayyappa, his own biological son, Raja Rajan, was born. Both the boys grew up in a princely manner. Ayyappa, or Manikandan, was intelligent and excelled in martial arts and the knowledge of various shastras, or scriptures. He surprised everyone with his superhuman powers. Upon completing his princely training and studies when he offered gurudakshina, or a fee to his guru, the master, aware of his divine power, asked him for a blessing of sight and speech for his blind and dumb son. Manikantan placed his hand on the boy, and the miracle happened.</p>
