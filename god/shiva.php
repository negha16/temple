			<div class="box-content"><p>Shiva (Siva) is one of the most important gods in the Hindu pantheon and is considered a member of the holy trinity (trimurti) of Hinduism with Brahma and Vishnu.

			<div class="box-content"><h4>1. The story behind Shiva's blue throat</h4>
<p>Also known by the name of Neelkantha, Shiva got the blue neck after drinking the poison, Halahala, during the Churning of Ocean (Samudra Manthan) to get the elixir of life (Amrit).<p>

<p>The legend says that during Samudra Manthan, the ocean of the milk was being churned by the devas and asuras, the first thing to appear was a dark sticky foam, the poison Halahala that had the power to destroy the universe. Soon, its fumes started to spread in the air and water. Shiva drank it to save the world. Goddess Parvati caught hold of his neck to avoid the poison from entering his body and so it remained in his throat making it blue coloured. </p><br>
<h4>2.The story why Shiva covers his body with ash</h4>
<p>Shivaâ€™s body is always covered with ash and his devotees wear an ash tilak. It is said that he wears ash to remind his devotees about reality, and foolishness of getting enamored by physical beauty.</p>

<p>The story goes like this. One day the powerful sage Parnada was cutting some grass when he cut his finger and instead of blood his finger oozed the sap of a tree, and he was filled with pride. Shiva who witnessed this event took the guise of an old man and asked him the reason for his delight, and Parnada said that he had become the most pious man in the world. But the old man questioned the sage's joy saying that it was just sap; when trees and plants are burned they turn into ash. The old man demonstrated it by slicing his finger and spilled ash. Sage Parnada realized that it was Shiva before him and asked him to forgive his ignorance.</p><br>
 <h4>3.The story of Ganga flowing from Shiva's head </h4> 
<p>Among the number of legends associated with Ganga and Shiva, the most famous one goes like this:</p>

<p>Once, Bhagiratha asked Brahma to bring the river Ganges down to earth to purify the souls of his ancestors and help them to attain nirvana. Brahma asked Bhagiratha to propitiate Shiva, for only he could break Ganga's landfall. Ganga arrogantly flew down to earth but Shiva calmly trapped her back in his matted locks and let her out in seven streams; Bhagirathi, Janhvi, Bhilangana, Mandakini, Rishiganga, Saraswati, and Alaknanda. She then followed Bhagiratha, who lead her to his ancestors and with her purity, released their souls. </p>
